# Xamelot Completion

This extension helps with editing XAML files by providing a few features:

- **Auto-completion**: Automatically completes XAML tags and attributes.
- **Hover information**: Shows information about the hovered XAML element.
- **Signature help**: Shows information about the parameters of a XAML element.
- **Formatting**: Formats XAML content.

## History

This extension is based on the **XML Complete** by **Michal Rogalinski**. The original extension was created for XML files, but it also works for XAML files. This extension is a fork of the original extension with a few modifications to better support XAML files.
